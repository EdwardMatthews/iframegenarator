      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "what": {
        "question": "What is an iframe generator and how does it work?",
        "answer": "An iframe generator is a specialized tool that helps you create and customize HTML iframe elements. Our iframe generator simplifies the process of generating embed codes by providing an intuitive interface for configuring iframe attributes, security settings, and styling options. Simply enter your URL, customize the settings using our iframe maker tools, and get instant, optimized code ready for your website."
      },
      "security": {
        "question": "How does the iframe generator ensure security?",
        "answer": "Our iframe generator implements comprehensive security features including sandbox restrictions and Content Security Policy (CSP) compatibility checks. When you generate iframe code, we automatically configure secure settings through sandbox attributes and permission controls, ensuring your embedded content is both safe and functional."
      },
      "compatibility": {
        "question": "Why can't I embed certain websites?",
        "answer": "Some websites restrict iframe embedding through security headers like X-Frame-Options or Content Security Policy (CSP). This is a standard security practice to prevent clickjacking and other security risks. Our generator automatically detects these restrictions and notifies you immediately, saving time in development."
      },
      "responsive": {
        "question": "How do I make my iframes mobile-friendly?",
        "answer": "Our iframe generator provides responsive design options including percentage-based widths and flexible height settings. You can use values like '100%' for width to make the iframe adapt to its container, and set appropriate height values to ensure proper display across all devices. We also support custom CSS for advanced responsive behaviors."
      },
      "customize": {
        "question": "What customization options are available?",
        "answer": "Our generator offers comprehensive customization options including: responsive dimensions (width/height), border styling (width, color, style, radius), spacing controls (margin, padding), background colors, sandbox security options, and feature permissions (camera, microphone, etc.). All changes are previewed in real-time before generating the final code."
      },
      "implementation": {
        "question": "How do I implement the generated iframe code?",
        "answer": "Simply copy the generated HTML code and paste it into your website's HTML where you want the embedded content to appear. The code is optimized for performance and includes all necessary attributes and styles. You can also customize the code further using your own CSS if needed."
